My fiancée loves her new Mac. I recevied this email earlier today.

> Where is CTRL ALT DEL… If there is no equivalent, how can I find out what applications or processes are running in the background and force quit them when they’re not supposed to be running?
> 
> What is “mission control”? If it doesn’t show me stuff that’s running, what good is it?
> 
> How come a window opens for every freakin’ hard drive every time I turn this thing on? Am I too stupid to know which hard drive I intend on looking at, so they’re just like, “Here it is! Well, whatever you’re looking for is in one of theeese places! You’re welcome!”
> 
> Why are all my problems not solved? How come life isn't easier and video doesn’t edit itself and I haven’t had sex with this computer yet?
> 
> How come my editing time is twice as long on a Mac as on a PC? I thought I was supposed to morph into a hipster artistic fricken genius/vegetarian by now.
