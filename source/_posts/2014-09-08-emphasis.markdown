Command-line tools should emphasize the feature that you most likely want to use given the situation (context-sensitive, so to speak). If you run the `foo` command in an empty directory, it should help you out.

```
$ foo
You ran `foo` in an empty directory. You might want to run `foo init` to get started.
```

Someone on a podcast I listened to recently called this "emphasis".
