I am experienced with all aspects of R&D, having worked in support, testing, development, and configuration management. I'm interested in what makes a high performing team. I study just as much the social and psychological systems at play in organizations as the technical systems. I have begun exploring strategic mapping, as a combination of position (where) and movement (what and why, in context). My strengths lie in research and collection/presentation of information and an ability to be effective in new subjects, domains, and technical areas quickly. I tend towards activities that educate and multiply the team's overall effectiveness. I'm always looking for opportunities to lead and influence others.
