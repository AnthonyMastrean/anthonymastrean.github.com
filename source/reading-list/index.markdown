## Coming Up

## In Progress

**[Good to Great](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0066620996?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Jim Collins

> _coming soon!_

**[Godel, Escher, Bach](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465026567?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Douglas Hofstadter

> This book is a confusing mixture of mathematics, musical theory, and art... wrapped up in a fairy tale narrative! I got stuck about 70 pages in :) I think I'll ignore the complicated problems and read it quickly for the story... see if anything interesting happens.

## Books

**[An Agile Adoption and Transformation Survival Guide](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1105735729?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Michael Sahota

> _coming soon!_

**[The Visible Ops Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0975568612?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Kevin Behr, Gene Kim, et al.

> _coming soon!_

**[Visual and Statistical Thinking](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0961392134?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Edward Tufte

> Another chapter from Tufte's book, [Visual Explanations](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0961392126?tag=anthonymastre-20), and it's a great one. The concept that your graphics should be evidence, that they should make your scientific argument (x causes y) should not come as a surprise.

**[Culture and Empire](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GF48Z4S?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Peter Hintjens

> I started with Lessig's similar book, [Free Culture](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143034650?tag=anthonymastre-20), but I found the writing so poor, I had to put it down. This book does wonders, though! It's almost sci-fi in its concepts (look at the table of contents), but also grounded in real technology and change.

**[The Gervais Principle](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F9IV64W?tag=anthonymastre-20) & [Be Slightly Evil](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F8JTYH8?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Venkatesh Rao

> Very interesting stuff in these books on office/world [sociological structures](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/hughMcLeodCompanyHierarchy.jpg)... but I don't think this stuff is for me, I don't want to play the game. And I ended up not really enjoying the content of the second book. I hope I'm not one of the clueless!

**[Understanding Computation](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CT3C4IM?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Tom Stuart

> In an attempt to understand GEB (below), I picked up this book that teaches you about computation... state machines, turing machines, parsing, etc., but disguised as simple Ruby programs.

**[Making Software](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596808321?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Andy Oram

> This book re-examines all the important software development research. It starts dry, but was insightful into experiment design, concordance, and other terms that help us think about research properly. The later chapters go in-depth into the actual studies of pair programming, team composition, defect to metric tracking. Great stuff overall!

**[Windows PowerShell in Action](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1932394907?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Bruce Payette

> Deep technical review of PowerShell features, usage, and intentions. Good resource for Windows developers and sysadmins who want to have a scripting language and a powerful shell at their disposal (finally!). I chewed through the early chapters quickly but I am slowing down because I don't see myself using a lot of the advanced script stuff.

**[The Inmates are Running the Asylum](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0672326140?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Alan Cooper

> You're going to rethink design when you're done with this book. Everyone in every organization needs to understand personas and interaction design up front. The idea that the quality of the product lies with the designer is killer. Restore the sanity!

**[Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735619670?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Steve McConnell

> Must read for beginning programmers of any language. This is a practical guide to good software construction (maintainable, readable, etc). The later chapters (in Software Craftsmanship) waste a lot of time on outdated things, like code layout and tools. But, the Personal Character section is still a gem.

**[Lean Software Development](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321150783?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Mary & Tom Poppendieck

> I'm glad I waited for the good parts: queue theory, empower teams, and systems thinking. If you're familiar with XP practices, skip right to chapter 4. Then have management read the whole damn thing :)

**[Systemantics](http://www.amazon.com/dp/070450331X?tag=anthonymastre-20)** John Gall

> I've never heard anyone describe "systems" theory like this. Extremely recommended for anyone who has written software for a large organization or used "enterprise" software. Systems will grow, are unpredictable, will create new systems... and worst of all, they create systems people. Learn about systems or be consumed by them.

**[Release It!](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0978739213?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Michael Nygard

> Release your product! And be prepared for capacity spikes, outages, and error reporting. I particularly like the programming patterns of fail fast and circuit breaker. There are systems engineering concepts in here that programmers might find interesting, too.

**[Microserfs](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061624268?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Douglas Coupland

> This is an odd book about a group of developers in Silicon Valley leaving big companies for a startup. It was too dated for me. A piece of software culture that I never experienced (being too young). It felt like the Netscape documentary, [Code Rush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u404SLJj7ig).

**[Getting Real](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0578012812?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson

> I love 37signals's strategy of keeping the company small, having strong opinions, and creating simple design.

**[Rework](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307463745?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson

> Another gem by the guys at 37signals. This is a refreshing and encouraging denouncement of meetings, distractions, and other kinds of waste that are so common in business.

**[The Three Signs of a Miserable Job](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0787995312?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Patrick Lencioni

> Another fictional story by Lencioni. It seems that software developers take the quality of their work personally and so it affects the quality of their life. The three signs are anonymity, irrelevance, and immeasurement.

**[The Art of Agile Development](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596527675?tag=anthonymastre-20)** James Shore

> We refer to this book at work as "the XP book". Yeah, there are others, but this is the one we read. The explanation of engineering principles are wonderful. I haven't seen a section like "contraindications" in any other text. It's advice for when you're doing it wrong, because often we are.

**[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0787960756?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Patrick Lencioni

> An interesting fictional story about a CEO optimizing her team. Fundamental concepts for any agile organization or small teams of programmers: trust, conflict, commitment, accountability, and results.

**[The Elements of Style](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0205313426?tag=anthonymastre-20)** William Strunk & E.B. White

> Everyone should read this book every year or so. Simplify your language, introduce clarity, and develop a style. If this doesn't apply to software development, I don't know what does. 

**[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131177052?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Michael Feathers

> So many concepts at play here: mocks, CQRS, scratch refactoring, delete code, OCP... the list goes on! Such a rich introduction to practical coding concepts wrapped up as a guide to refactoring legacy code. I really learned good programming from working on legacy projects.

**[The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0961392169?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Edward Tufte

> My earliest foray into presentation zen. Tufte shows that PowerPoint reduces the analytical quality of presentations, corrupts statistical reasoning, and weakens verbal thinking.

**[Code](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735611319?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Charles Petzold

> You can immediately replace your computer architecture textbook with this one. The first third is dedicated to codes and counting systems. The second third is gates, switches, and other logic operators. And only in the last third do we start talking about memory and computers (in some form).

**[Peopleware](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633439?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Tom DeMarco, Timothy Lister

> Wow. All problems in software are people problems (there are no technical problems that can't be solved). This early book on distractions, productivity, ways to kill teams, and how teams thrive is essential reading. In present time, 37signals continues a lot of the same work.

**[The Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Fred Brooks

> Brooks reveals a deep understanding of software project management with essays on No Silver Bullet, the Surgical Team, and Essential Difficulties. I'm wondering how much is dated (by advances in agile and lean practices... I'll have to re-read soon).

**[Framework Design Guidelines](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321246756?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Krzysztof Cwalina & Brad Abrams

> Really neat guide and introduction to idiomatic .NET. I like the sections: Consider, Do Not, Do, and Avoid. And the notes by the framework creators are helpful.

**[Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321117425?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Robert Glass

> This is a great book for beginning practitioners. It packs a ton of learning (65 fallacies discovered over several decades) into a small package (less than 200 pages). I had been reading Robert Glass in ACM publications.

**[The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465067107?tag=anthonymastre-20)** Donald Norman

> My first design book and there's not a single sentence about software. Norman really breaks down frustrating design. And what's more frustrating than unusable software?
