I'm an experienced enterprise application developer and a budding DevOps enthusiast. I also draw on experiences working on support, test, and operations teams. I've worked on mobile, kiosk, and hardware applications. I've been around strict compliance environments, including SOX, PCIDSS, HIPAA, and FDA.

I'm experienced working with offshore teams, teams in multiple locations, and mixed local/remote teams. I find myself gravitating toward mentorship, leading technical teams, and even software architecture.
