> See my [story](https://stackoverflow.com/story/anthonymastrean) (or [resume](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/anthonymastrean)) on StackOverflow.

I'm an experienced enterprise application developer and a budding DevOps enthusiast. I also draw on experiences working on support, test, and operations teams. I've worked on mobile, kiosk, and hardware applications. I've been around strict compliance environments, including SOX, PCIDSS, HIPAA, and FDA.

I'm experienced working with offshore teams, teams in multiple locations, and mixed local/remote teams. I gravitate toward mentorship, leading technical direction and training, and providing solid software architecture.
