I'm an experienced enterprise application developer and a budding DevOps enthusiast. I'm happy to cross traditional lines, drawing on my experiences on the support desk, in a test team, and in operations roles. I've worked in constrained environments, too, including ruggedized mobile devices, kiosks, and hardware applications. And I've dealt with strict compliance/regulations, including: SOX, PCIDSS, HIPAA, and FDA.

I've worked with offshore teams, teams in multiple locations, and mixed local/remote teams (having most recently worked remote for 2 years). I gravitate toward mentorship, leading technical direction and peer training, and providing solid software architecture.

[Contact me](mailto:anthony.mastrean@gmail.com) and let's make great teams!
