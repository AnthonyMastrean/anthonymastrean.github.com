I'm an experienced enterprise application developer and a budding DevOps enthusiast. I'm happy to cross traditional
lines, drawing on my experiences on the support desk, in a test team, and in operations roles. I've worked in
constrained environments, too, including ruggedized mobile devices, kiosks, and hardware applications. And I've dealt
with strict compliance/regulations, including: SOX, PCIDSS, HIPAA, and FDA.

I've worked with offshore teams, teams in multiple locations, and mixed local/remote teams (having most recently worked
remote for 2 years). I gravitate toward mentorship, leading technical direction and peer training, and providing solid
software architecture.
