I'm an experienced enterprise application developer and a budding DevOps
enthusiast. I'm happy to cross traditional lines, drawing on my experiences on
the support desk, in a test team, and in operations roles. I've worked in
constrained environments, too, including ruggedized mobile devices, kiosks, and
hardware applications. And I've dealt with strict compliance/regulations,
including: SOX, PCIDSS, HIPAA, and FDA.
<br />
I've worked with offshore teams, teams in multiple locations, and mixed local
and remote teams. I gravitate toward mentorship, leading technical direction
and peer training, and providing solid software architecture.
