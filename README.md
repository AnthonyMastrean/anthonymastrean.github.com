## Getting Started

Jekyll 3 seems to work on a vanilla Windows machine now! Install these
applications:

```
$ choco install --yes ruby ruby2.devkit nodejs
```

## Building the Site

Install the site prerequisites.

```
$ bundle install
```

Build and serve the site.


```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Publishing

Just push to the `master` branch and GitHub will do the rest!
